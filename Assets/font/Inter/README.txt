Inter Variable Font
===================

This download contains Inter as both a variable font and static fonts.

Inter is a variable font with these axes:
  slnt
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that arenâ€™t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Inter:
  static/Inter-Thin.ttf
  static/Inter-ExtraLight.ttf
  static/Inter-Light.ttf
  static/Inter-Regular.ttf
  static/Inter-Medium.ttf
  static/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
  static/Inter-Bold.ttf
  static/Inter-ExtraBold.ttf
  static/Inter-Black.ttf

available styles
